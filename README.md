# SwimCamp Signup Form
A signup form implemented for practice using HTML form concepts and CSS styling for the form. It is tailored for swimmers looking for gear/equipment through an e-commerce website.

> [!NOTE]
> The signup form is for demonstration purposes only. The "Create Account" button and "Log in" link do not actually perform any authentication or account creation. They are included purely to simulate the appearance and flow of a real form.
